# Road Map Project Community and Technical College Technical Appendix

## Data Sources
The analyses contanined in this project combine students’ high school enrollment records with CTC and National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) college enrollment records. CTC records are collected from the individual colleges by the State Board for Community and Technical Colleges (SBCTC). ERDC performs all matching of student information between data sets, providing CCER with linked research IDs that allow us to perform longitudinal analyses. ERDC does not provide us with data for students outside the Road Map region.

## Student Cohort Selection

## Technical Definitions of Disaggregation Categories
**Race/Ethnicity:** The racial or ethnic group designated by the student’s high school.

**Full-Time Student:** In this report, students are considered full-time if their average per-quarter course-load is 12 or more credits. To compute this, we divide a student’s total credits enrolled over the 3-year period by their total number of enrolled quarters (omitting any credits and enrollments during summer quarters). 

**Running Start Student:** To be counted, students must have participated in Running Start at any local CTC, and are counted even if they enroll in a different CTC after graduating high school than the CTC at which they took courses as part of Running Start. We use the field provided in SBCTC enrollment data that indicates whether a student has participated in Running Start at a particular institution. 

**Avoiding Developmental Education:** Students are considered not college-ready if they enroll in any pre-college coursework in math or English at any time during the 3-year period. We follow the SBCTC definition of pre-college level courses, which counts any course numbered below 100 to be at the pre-college level.21 College-ready students are those who did not take pre-college math or English during the 3-year period. The group of college-ready students may include some students that never took college-level math or English and thus may have either dropped out of college before taking college-level courses or were in a certificate program that did not require college-level math or English courses.

## Technical Definitions of Indicators
For each indicator, time is measured in quarters (1 year = 4 quarters), and starts at the first quarter a student enrolls during the academic year directly following their high school graduation year.

### **Becoming College-Ready in Math**
This indicator measures the proportion of students that were college-ready in math by the end of their second year (i.e. took a college level math in their first two years).

**Numerator:** The number of students that take one or more college math courses during their first two years.

**Denominator:** All students included in the cohort (see section ‘Student Cohort Selection’).

### **Completing 30 College Credits Within One Year** 
A student meets this metric if they complete 30 or more college-level credits within one full academic year of their first enrollment.

**Numerator:** The number of students that earn 30 or more college-level credits during their first year. 

**Denominator:** All students included in the cohort (see section ‘Student Cohort Selection’).

### **Concentration in First Year**
This indicator measures ...
